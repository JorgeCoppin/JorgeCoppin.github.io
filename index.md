## Biography
<img style="float: right;" src="/assets/img/JorgeCoppin3.jpg" width="30%">

I'm a PhD student at [Cornell University's EAS Department](https://www.eas.cornell.edu/eas), where I'm advised by Britney Schmidt.

Prior to grad school, I studied Mechanical Engineering at the [Univeristy of Puerto Rico](https://www.uprm.edu/portada/).

<!-- I'm currently in my senior year working toward a Robotics Engineering degree at Olin College of Engineering, a small undergraduate-only school in Needham, MA. At Olin, I do research with the [Olin Robotics Lab](https://olinrobotics.github.io/) and currently lead the [Ground Vehicle Research group](https://github.com/olinrobotics/gravl/wiki), doing work with autonomous vehicles in unstructured environments. After Olin, I hope to continue working on research projects that leverage machine learning to solve navigation & perception problems on board mobile exploration robots. -->
